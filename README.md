source code for Code Louisville's Front-end Web Development Sept. 2021 cohort final project, a build out of a design by Don Hansen

## fonts

fonts used are [Quantico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quantico?query=quantico) and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans). i converted the .ttf files to .woff2 as the later is much smaller in size. i used [woff2](https://github.com/google/woff2) from google so the conversion didn't "break the axes needed to interpolate between font variation settings."
